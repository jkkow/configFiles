  {"id":"chenChromaticDispersionMeasurements2023","abstract":"Chromatic dispersion is an important fiber attribute affecting transmission performance over optical fibers. Various chromatic dispersion measurement methods have been developed primarily for single-mode fibers. In the literature, measurement techniques were also developed to characterize few-mode fibers and multi-mode fibers. These methods are often subject to some limitations. In this paper, a simple and robust measurement method for chromatic dispersion measurement of single-mode fibers, polarization--maintaining fibers, and few-mode fibers is presented using a frequency domain instrument and a vector network analyzer. The method is applied to all three types of fibers through one measurement methodology uniformly. Using a vector network analyzer, the measurement instrument obtains the complex transfer function of fiber transmission. The inverse Fourier transform of the measured complex transfer function is used to determine the group delays for each mode of the fiber. Although the sampling is highly under-sampled for the whole fiber link, through proper treatment of the data, we can de-alias the signals and obtain accurate values of the group delays of each mode. By measuring the group delays over different wavelengths, the data can yield the chromatic dispersion of each mode over the wavelength window.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Hurley","given":"Jason E."},{"family":"Stone","given":"Jeffery S."},{"family":"Li","given":"Ming-Jun"}],"citation-key":"chenChromaticDispersionMeasurements2023","container-title":"Photonics","DOI":"10.3390/photonics10020215","ISSN":"2304-6732","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"215","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Chromatic Dispersion Measurements of Single-Mode Fibers, Polarization-Maintaining Fibers, and Few-Mode Fibers Using a Frequency Domain Method","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6732/10/2/215","volume":"10"},

The modal conditioning single-mode fiber has a mode field diameter at 1310Â nm roughly matching that of the fundamental mode of the 50-Î¼m core multimode fibers. The fiber is designed for integration in a compact adapter due to its low fiber cutoff wavelength. The adapters are attached to both the input and output ends of the multimode fiber to form a link suitable for single-mode transmission. The detailed characteristics of the link such as insertion loss and multi-path interference are measured. Using the adapters, we demonstrate error-free transmission over 1-km multimode fiber using a 100G CWDM4 transceiver, which carries 4Â ÃÂ 25Â Gb/s transmission at four wavelengths around 1310Â nm.

  {"id":"chenWavelengthtunableEntangledPhotons2016","abstract":"Many of the quantum information applications rely on indistinguishable sources of polarization-entangled photons. Semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for a deterministic entangled photon source; however, due to their random growth nature, it is impossible to find different quantum dots emitting entangled photons with identical wavelengths. The wavelength tunability has therefore become a fundamental requirement for a number of envisioned applications, for example, nesting different dots via the entanglement swapping and interfacing dots with cavities/atoms. Here we report the generation of wavelength-tunable entangled photons from on-chip integrated InAs/GaAs quantum dots. With a novel anisotropic strain engineering technique based on PMN-PT/silicon micro-electromechanical system, we can recover the quantum dot electronic symmetry at different exciton emission wavelengths. Together with a footprint of several hundred microns, our device facilitates the scalable integration of indistinguishable entangled photon sources on-chip, and therefore removes a major stumbling block to the quantum-dot-based solid-state quantum information platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiaxiang"},{"family":"Zopf","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Kyubong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Keil","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Oliver G."}],"citation-key":"chenWavelengthtunableEntangledPhotons2016","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms10387","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,27]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"10387","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Wavelength-tunable entangled photons from silicon-integrated IIIâV quantum dots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10387","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"downieAssessingCapacityCost2020","abstract":"We assess the potential applicability and performance of multicore fibers (MCFs) against conventional single-core fibers (SCFs) in submarine transmission systems. In particular, we assume 4-core MCFs with nominally uncoupled cores and separate amplification of each MCF core with conventional erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) using fan-in/fan-out (FI/FO) devices in the repeaters. We examine the effects of the number of physical fibers accommodated in the cable design, MCF and FI/FO crosstalk, FI/FO loss, span length, transceiver implementation penalty, and minimum required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The relative cable capacities offered by the MCF and SCF systems are evaluated under the different conditions. Then the relative cost/capacity for systems built with the two types of fiber are calculated using a system cost model for two conditions: 1) with maximum cable capacity and 2) for minimum overall cost/capacity. The potential role of multicore fibers (MCFs) in submarine cable systems is investigated in the context of electrical power limitations and physical fiber count limitations. Cable capacities are estimated based on ideal Shannon-limited capacity unless a transceiver implementation penalty, or gap-to-Shannon capacity, is applied. The systems are modeled assuming constant output power amplifiers as are commonly deployed in submarine systems. We find that MCFs offer the greatest cable capacity increase for low fiber count cables, but that the cost/capacity can be significantly higher. When minimization of cost/capacity is the design goal, MCF systems remain higher in this metric than SCF systems, while enabling only a small capacity increase at best.","author":[{"family":"Downie","given":"John D."},{"family":"Liang","given":"Xiaojun"},{"family":"Makovejs","given":"Sergejs"}],"citation-key":"downieAssessingCapacityCost2020","container-title":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","DOI":"10.1109/JLT.2020.2980955","ISSN":"1558-2213","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"page":"3015-3022","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Assessing Capacity and Cost/Capacity of 4-Core Multicore Fibers Against Single Core Fibers in Submarine Cable Systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for real-time DSP-free intensity-modulation/direct-detection (IM/DD) MDM transmission, in which the transmission few-mode fiber (FMF) is characterized by multiple-ring-core structure to suppress modal crosstalk among each LP mode, while each pair of non-circularly-symmetric degenerate modes is simultaneously demultiplexed by a degenerate-mode-selective fiber coupler for DSP-free reception. Based on a 10 km ultralow-modal-crosstalk double-ring-core FMF and a pair of all-fiber 4-LP-mode MUX/DEMUX, we demonstrate the first IM/DD MDM prototype system using commercial single-mode (SM) 10 Gbps SFP + modules and 4K video transceivers without any hardware modifications. The temperature and wavelength dependence are evaluated. The stable Q2-factor performance proves that it can be a smooth evolution scheme from conventional SM IM/DD systems. Moreover, the scheme can be further extended to support more modes with improved FMF design adopting more ring areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Yuyang"},{"family":"Ge","given":"Dawei"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Junchi"},{"family":"He","given":"Yongqi"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhangyuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Guifang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Juhao"}],"citation-key":"gaoPrototypeSystemRealtime2019","container-title":"Optics Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

  {"id":"guoUltralowloss5LPMode2023","abstract":"Trapped in the stringent adiabatic transmission condition of high-order modes, low-loss fused biconical taper mode selective coupler (FBT-MSC) has long been challenging to achieve. We identify the adiabatic predicament of high-order modes to stem from the rapid variation of the eigenmode field diameter, which is caused by the large core-cladding diameter difference of few-mode fiber (FMF). We demonstrate that introducing a positive-index inner cladding in FMF is an effective approach to address this predicament. The optimized FMF can be used as dedicated fiber for FBT-MSC fabrication, and exhibits good compatibility with the original fibers, which is critical for the wide adoption of MSC. As an example, we add inner cladding in a step-index FMF to achieve excellent adiabatic high-order mode characteristics. The optimized fiber is used to manufacture ultra-low-loss 5-LP MSC.

A small non-phase-matched four-wave mixing (FWM) signal was prevalently observed in the fiber at the power level where other nonlinear processes, including self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation, were well suppressed. We analyzed the features of the FWM signal generation by varying the location of temporal overlap between two input pulses in the fiber to compare this to the CARS signal generated in the sample. Numerical modeling based on the nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation was also conducted and clearly explains the results in the experiment. In addition, we experimentally verified the interferometric feature of this FWM signal with the CARS signal by employing a phase-shifting unit, which potentially suggests the use of the FWM signal as a local oscillator for the interferometric CARS system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Jun","given":"Chang Su"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Byoung Yoon"},{"family":"Park","given":"Ju Hyun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jae Yong"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Eun Seong"},{"family":"Yeom","given":"Dong-Il"}],"citation-key":"junInvestigationFourwaveMixing2010","container-title":"Applied Optics","container-title-short":"Appl.

We find that there are two kinds of single di-Ï bonding configurations: One is the on-top (OT) structure on top of a single Si dimer and the other is the end-bridge (EB) structure across the ends of two adjacent Si dimers in the same dimer row. Formation of the OT and EB structures is kinetically facilitated through the Ï-complex precursor state in which the electron-deficient down Si atom of the buckled dimer attracts the Ï bond of 1,4-cyclohexadiene. However, there exists a drastic difference in dehydrogenation kinetics of the two single di-Ï bonding configurations. Dehydrogenation of the OT structure hardly takes place because of the existence of a high activation barrier of 1.34eV, whereas that of the EB structure is kinetically feasible at room temperature with a relatively lower activation barrier of 0.68eV. Thus, we can say that the recently observed dehydrogenation process in the single di-Ï bonding configuration would be associated with the EB structure rather than the OT structure. We also discuss the recent experimental data about the desorption of produced benzene and the formation of double di-Ï bonding configuration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ko","given":"Jae-Kwon"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Jun-Hyung"}],"citation-key":"koDehydrogenation4cyclohexadieneSi2008","container-title":"Physical Review B","container-title-short":"Phys.

The technique is based on the axial modulation of AO coupling strength along a highly birefringent optical fiber, which is achieved by tailoring the outer diameter of the fiber along its propagation axis. Two kinds of filter spectral shaping schemes&#x2014;Gaussian apodization and matched filtering with triple resonance peaks&#x2014;are proposed and numerically investigated under realistic experimental conditions: at the 50-cm-long AO interaction length of the fiber and at half of the original fiber diameter as the minimum thickness of the tailored fiber section. The results show that the highest peak of sidelobe spectra in filter transmission is suppressed from 11.64&#x25; to 0.54&#x25; via Gaussian modulation of the AO coupling coefficient (&#x3BA;). Matched filtering with triple resonance peaks operating with a single radio frequency signal is also achieved by cosine modulation of &#x3BA;, of which the modulation period determines the spectral distance between two satellite peaks located in both wings of the main resonance peak. The splitting of two satellite peaks in the filter spectra reaches 48.2&#xA0;nm while the modulation period varies from 7.7 to 50&#xA0;cm. The overall peak power of two satellite resonances is calculated to be 22&#x25; of the main resonance power.

Using the proposed method, two strands of tapered fibers are fabricated, having 0.82-Î¼m/1.6-Î¼m diameters, 220-mm/500-mm uniform lengths with <55-nm/66-nm diameter variances, and high transmittances of 90.2%/91.5%. A figure of merit indicating the nonlinear-optic efficiency is defined and used to compare the results obtained in this study with those for tapered fibers in references. The proposed tapering method will be very useful for the fabrication of tapered fiber devices exploiting nonlinear optic effects, including Brillouin scattering, Raman amplification, and other third-order nonlinearities for supercontinuum generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Donghwa"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kwang Jo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jin-Hun"},{"family":"Park","given":"Kyungdeuk"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dongjin"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yoon-Ho"},{"family":"Shin","given":"Heedeuk"}],"citation-key":"leeFabricationMethodUltralong2019","container-title":"Current Applied Physics","container-title-short":"Current Applied Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.cap.2019.08.018","ISSN":"1567-1739","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1334-1337","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fabrication method for ultra-long optical micro/nano-fibers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567173919302160","volume":"19"},

The technique relies on a long period grating mechanically induced in a two-mode fiber. A compact, portable apparatus was designed and fabricated, where period-variable metallic corrugation is implemented to form periodic micro-bends along the fiber. The coupling strength between the interacting fiber modes and the grating period can be tuned continuously and individually using two control knobs in the apparatus. Experimental results show that the complete coupling between the LP01 and LP11 modes is achieved, which is confirmed by an observed over-coupling while increasing the grating strength. For the short fiber length of <1.9Â cm (33 grating periods), large band-rejection of â32.5Â dB was obtained at resonance. The band rejection efficiency over 98.6% have been achieved in the entire communication C-band. As the grating strength increased, two over-couplings were observed at resonance, which indicates the high efficiency of the device.

  {"id":"liModeDivisionMultiplexed2021","abstract":"Mode division multiplexing (MDM) has attracted great attention in recent years to increase the network capacity. To apply MDM in data center applications, a low-cost and low power consumption system is desired. In this letter, we utilize 850-nm single-mode VCSEL as the laser source and report mode division multiplexed transmission over a standard single-mode fiber, which is two-mode at 850 nm. Due to the small spot size and low numerical aperture, single-mode VCSEL can be coupled into single-mode fibers with low loss. The mode multiplexer and de-multiplexer devices are designed and fabricated based on fiber mode selective couplers using Hi780 fiber as the 850-nm single-mode launch and receiving fiber and standard single-mode fiber as the few-mode transmission fiber. The MDM system supports two channels, corresponding to the LP01 and LP11 mode in the few-mode transmission fiber.

Thus, control of spatial mode generation becomes a crucial technique especially in fiber optics, which has been exploited to high capacity space division multiplexing. The acousto-optic interactions in few-mode fibers provide a potential solution to tackle the bottleneck of traditional spatial mode conversion devices. Acousto-optic mode conversion controlled by microwave signals brings tremendous new opportunities in spatial mode generation with fast mode tuning and dynamic switching capabilities. Besides, dynamic mode switching induced by acousto-optic effects contributes an energy modulation inside a laser cavity through nonlinear effects of multi-mode interaction, competition, which endows the fiber laser with new functions and leads to the exploration of new physical mechanism. In this review, we present the recent advances of controlling mode switch and generation employing acousto-optic interactions in few-mode fibers, which includes acousto-optic mechanisms, optical field manipulating devices and novel applications of spatial mode control especially in high-order mode fiber lasers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Jiafeng"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jiangtao"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Linghao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Longkun"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Peikang"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xuan"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Fufei"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Xianglong"}],"citation-key":"luRecentProgressDynamic2021","container-title":"Nanophotonics","DOI":"10.1515/nanoph-2020-0461","ISSN":"2192-8614","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,3]]},"language":"en","page":"983-1010","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Recent progress of dynamic mode manipulation via acousto-optic interactions in few-mode fiber lasers: mechanism, device and applications","title-short":"Recent progress of dynamic mode manipulation via acousto-optic interactions in few-mode fiber lasers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/nanoph-2020-0461/html?lang=en","volume":"10"},

Aim: In this tutorial, we introduce a raytracing module for Python, originally developed for teaching optics with ray matrices, to simplify the design and optimization of optical systems. Approach: This module is developed for ray matrix calculations in Python. Many important concepts of optical design that are often poorly understood such as apertures, aperture stops, and field stops are illustrated. Results: The module is explained with examples in real systems with collection efficiency, vignetting, and intensity profiles. Also, the optical invariant, an important benchmark property for optical systems, is used to characterize an optical system.

  {"id":"richardsonHighPowerFiber2010","abstract":"The rise in output power from rare-earth-doped fiber sources over the past decade, via the use of cladding-pumped fiber architectures, has been dramatic, leading to a range of fiber-based devices with outstanding performance in terms of output power, beam quality, overall efficiency, and flexibility with regard to operating wavelength and radiation format. This success in the high-power arena is largely due to the fiberâs geometry, which provides considerable resilience to the effects of heat generation in the core, and facilitates efficient conversion from relatively low-brightness diode pump radiation to high-brightness laser output. In this paper we review the current state of the art in terms of continuous-wave and pulsed performance of ytterbium-doped fiber lasers, the current fiber gain medium of choice, and by far the most developed in terms of high-power performance. We then review the current status and challenges of extending the technology to other rare-earth dopants and associated wavelengths of operation. Throughout we identify the key factors currently limiting fiber laser performance in different operating regimesâin particular thermal management, optical nonlinearity, and damage. Finally, we speculate as to the likely developments in pump laser technology, fiber design and fabrication, architectural approaches, and functionality that lie ahead in the coming decade and the implications they have on fiber laser performance and industrial/scientific adoption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"D.

  {"id":"sunAllfiberFaradayDevices2011","abstract":"Surface damage is one of the most problematic power limits in high-power fiber laser systems. All-fiber Faraday components are demonstrated as a solution to this problem, since they can be completely fusion-spliced into existing systems, eliminating all glass-air interfaces. Beam filamentation due to self-focusing places another limit on the peak power attainable from fiber laser systems. The limits imposed by this phenomenon are analyzed for the first time. The concept of an effective Verdet constant is proposed and experimentally validated. The effective Verdet constant of light propagation in a fiber includes contributions from the materials in both the core and the cladding. It is measured in a 25-wt% terbium-doped-core phosphate fiber to be --6.2 rad/(Tm) at 1053 nm, which is six times larger than silica fiber. The result agrees well with Faraday rotation theory in optical fiber. A compact all-fiber Faraday isolator and a Faraday mirror are demonstrated. At the core of each of these components is an all-fiber Faraday rotator made of a 4cm-long, 65-wt%-terbium-doped silicate fiber. The effective Verdet constant of the terbium-doped fiber is measured to be -32 rad/(Tm), which is 27x larger than that of silica fiber. This effective Verdet constant is the largest value measured to date in any fiber and is 83% of the Verdet constant of commercially available crystals used in bulk-optics-based isolators. Combining the all-fiber Faraday rotator with fiber polarizers results in a fully fusion-spliced all-fiber isolator whose isolation is measured to be 19 dB. Combining the all-fiber Faraday rotator with a fiber Bragg grating results in an all-fiber Faraday mirror that rotates the polarization state of the reflected light by 88 +/- 4Â°. An all-fiber optical magnetic field sensor is also demonstrated. It consists of a fiber Faraday rotator and a fiber polarizer. The fiber Faraday rotator uses a 2-cm-long section of 56-wt%-terbium-doped silicate fiber with a Verdet constant of -24.5 rad/(Tm) at 1053 nm. The fiber polarizer is Corning SP1060 single-polarization fiber. The sensor has a sensitivity of 0.49 rad/T and can measure magnetic fields from 0.02 to 3.2 T. An all-fiber wavelength-tunable laser based on Faraday rotation is proposed. It consists of an all-fiber wavelength-tunable filter in a conventional fiber laser cavity. The filter includes a fiber polarizer and a fiber Faraday mirror in which a chirped fiber Bragg grating is directly written onto the 65-wt% terbium fiber. The ytterbium-doped fiber in the laser is gain flattened using a. 1030/1090 rim WDM filter, resulting a net gain ripple that is measured to he less than 0.2 dB from 1047 to 1060 nm. The wavelength tuning range of the resulting fiber laser is therefore expected to be in this 1047 to 1060 nm range. Filamentation is one of the nonlinear peak-power-threshold limits in high-power fiber lasers. Starting from the paraxial wave equation, an analytic expression for the filamentation threshold in fiber lasers is derived using a perturbation method. The occurrence of filamentation is determined by the larger of two thresholds, one of perturbative gain and one of spatial confinement. The threshold value is around a few megawatts, depending on the parameters of the fiber.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"sunAllfiberFaradayDevices2011","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,1]]},"note":"ADS Bibcode: 2011PhDT........14S","source":"NASA ADS","title":"All-fiber Faraday Devices Based on Terbium-doped Fiber","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhDT........14S"},

  {"id":"talataisongReviewMicrofiberBasedTemperature2018","abstract":"Optical microfiber-based temperature sensors have been proposed for many applications in a variety of industrial uses, including biomedical, geological, automotive, and defense applications. This increasing demand for these micrometric devices is attributed to their large dynamic range, high sensitivity, fast-response, compactness and robustness. Additionally, they can perform in-situ measurements remotely and in harsh environments. This paper presents an overview of optical microfibers, with a focus on their applications in temperature sensing. This review broadly divides microfiber-based temperature sensors into two categories: resonant and non-resonant microfiber sensors. While the former includes microfiber loop, knot and coil resonators, the latter comprises sensors based on functionally coated/doped microfibers, microfiber couplers, optical gratings and interferometers. In the conclusions, a summary of reported performances is presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Talataisong","given":"Wanvisa"},{"family":"Ismaeel","given":"Rand"},{"family":"Brambilla","given":"Gilberto"}],"citation-key":"talataisongReviewMicrofiberBasedTemperature2018","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s18020461","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,4]]},"language":"en","page":"461","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Review of Microfiber-Based Temperature Sensors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/2/461","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"trancaNanoscaleLocalModification2023","abstract":"Investigation techniques based on tip-enhanced optical effects, capable to yield spatial resolutions down to nanometers level, have enabled a wide palette of important discoveries over the past twenty years. Recently, their underlying optical setups are beginning to emerge as useful tools to modify and manipulate matter with nanoscale spatial resolution. We try to contribute to these efforts by reporting a method that we found viable to modify the surface refractive index of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), an acrylic polymer material. The changes in the refractive index are accomplished by focusing a femtosecond pulsed near-infrared laser beam on the apex of a metalized nano-sized tip, traditionally used in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) applications. The adopted illumination strategy yields circular-shaped modifications of the refractive index occurring at the surface of the PMMA sample, exhibiting a lateral size <200 nm, under 790 nm illumination, representing a four-fold increase in precision compared to the current state-of-the-art. The light intensity enhancement effects taking place at the tip apex makes possible achieving refractive index changes at low laser pulse energies (<0.5 nJ), which represents two orders of magnitude advantage over the current state-of-the art. The presented nanoimprinting method is very flexible, as it can be used with different power levels and can potentially be operated with other materials. Besides enabling modifications of the refractive index with high lateral resolution, this method can pave the way towards other important applications such the fabrication of photonic crystal lattices or surface waveguides.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Tranca","given":"Denis E."},{"family":"Stanciu","given":"Stefan G."},{"family":"Hristu","given":"Radu"},{"family":"Ionescu","given":"Adrian M."},{"family":"Stanciu","given":"George A."}],"citation-key":"trancaNanoscaleLocalModification2023","container-title":"Applied Surface Science","container-title-short":"Applied Surface Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.157014","ISSN":"01694332","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,6]]},"page":"157014","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Nanoscale local modification of PMMA refractive index by tip-enhanced femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06159","volume":"623"},

  {"id":"zhangDynamicAnalysisPAM42023","abstract":"Mode-group-division multiplexing (MGDM)-based intensity modulation direct detection (IM/DD) transmission is an attractive approach to increase the capacity for short-reach optical communication. In this Letter, a simple but versatile scheme of mode group (MG) filtering for MGDM IM/DD transmission is proposed. The scheme is applicable to any mode basis in the fiber, and it satisfies the needs of low complexity, low power consumption, and high system performance. By employing the proposed MG filter scheme, a total raw bit rate of a 152-Gb/s multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-free IM/DD co-channel simultaneous transmit and receive system based on two orbital angular momentum (OAM) MGs, each carrying a 38-GBaud four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) signal, is experimentally demonstrated over a 5-km few-mode fiber (FMF). The bit error ratios (BERs) of the two MGs are below the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) BER threshold at 3.8Ã10-3, using simple feedforward equalization (FFE). Furthermore, the dependability and robustness of such MGDM links are of great significance. Thus, the dynamic evaluation of BER and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each MG is tested over 210 minutes under different conditions. In the dynamic cases, all the BER results using the proposed scheme can be below 1Ã10-3, which further confirms the stability and feasibility of our proposed MGDM transmission scheme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianbo"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiong"},{"family":"Lau","given":"Alan Pak Tao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhaohui"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Chao"}],"citation-key":"zhangDynamicAnalysisPAM42023","container-title":"Optics Letters","container-title-short":"Opt.

  {"id":"zhangSpontaneousParametricDownConversion2021","abstract":"Entangled photon sources are desirable and key elements for photonic quantum information processing. The spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process is a convenient way to produce entangled photon pairs. It has been widely used and has already made great contributions to quantum information science. SPDC sources have been thoroughly studied, and a detailed review, previously lacking, is now appropriate. In this article, different types of SPDC sources suitable for multiphoton experiments are reviewed. A comparison of their respective performances is presented, focusing on the parameters of indistinguishability, collection efficiency, and brightness, from which it is possible to see how the spatial and spectral properties of the SPDC process can be tailored, step by step, to achieve near-perfect photon pairs. Recent progress on multiplexed heralded single-photon sources, which effectively mitigate the nondeterministic nature of the SPDC process, is also described.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yun-Feng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bi-Heng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Chuan-Feng"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Guang-Can"}],"citation-key":"zhangSpontaneousParametricDownConversion2021","container-title":"Advanced Quantum Technologies","DOI":"10.1002/qute.202000132","ISSN":"2511-9044","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"2000132","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Sources for Multiphoton Experiments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qute.202000132","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"zhuMicrofiberEvanescentfieldPhotothermal2023","abstract":"In this study, we experimentally showcase the microfiber evanescent-field photothermal gas detection by exploiting all-fiber MHz-level frequency shift scheme. Based on the acousto-optic interaction effect, the low-frequency shifts of 0.9â¯MHz and 1.83â¯MHz can be obtained through the cyclic conversion between the transverse core modes LP 01 and LP 11 in the few-mode fiber. Our proposed all-fiber frequency shifters show flexible MHz-level up(down) frequency shifts with superior sideband rejection ratio (over 40â¯dB) and low insertion loss (less than 1â¯dB). Furthermore, an all-fiber heterodyne interferometric detection system is implemented by leveraging the above low-frequency shifters, in which around 1-Î¼m-diameter microfiber is investigated for photothermal gas detection. A pump-probe configuration is employed to obtain the photothermal effect induced by the gas absorption of the modulated evanescent field. By demodulating the phase of the beat signal output by the interferometer, an equivalent detection limit (1 Ï ) of 32â¯ppm and a response time of 22â¯s are achieved for ammonia, as well as 0.24â¯% instability within 48 pump cycles. Given its compact all-fiber configuration and high sensitivity with fast response, the experimental results can pave the way for widespread applications like heterodyne detection, fiber optical sensors, and interplanetary coherent communications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Anbo"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jiangtao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhengwei"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Fufei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Weijian"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Xianglong"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jianfeng"}],"citation-key":"zhuMicrofiberEvanescentfieldPhotothermal2023","container-title":"Nanophotonics","DOI":"10.1515/nanoph-2023-0092","ISSN":"2192-8614","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"language":"en","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Microfiber evanescent-field photothermal gas detection using acoustic-induced mode-dependent frequency shift","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/nanoph-2023-0092/html"}
